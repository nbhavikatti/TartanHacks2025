# TartanHacks2025
Our project for TartanHacks2025.

The goal of this project is to allow a user to upload pictures of receipts for transactions (such as food) and for a carbon score to be generated for them. Different metrics will be created for them and there will be a dashboard displaying their carbon score and the date ban
